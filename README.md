## 3. Connect Four
A retro grid-based game in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Connect Four is a two-player board game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping one colored disc from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

### Rules of the Game
1. You will start as player One
2. You will take your go as player One
3. You will not be allowed to go in squares that are not at the bottom of the grid, or do not have a taken square under it
4. Once your go is taken and you did not win, It will be player Two's go
5. The gamer will continue until a winning combination of four is reached by player One or player Two, or until the grid is full and no winning combination was found.
